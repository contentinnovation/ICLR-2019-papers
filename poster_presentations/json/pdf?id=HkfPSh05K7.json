The framework is agnostic to the architecture of the machine reading model, only requiring access to the token-level hidden representations of the reader. The retriever uses fast nearest neighbor search to scale to corpora containing millions of paragraphs. A gated recurrent unit updates the query at each step conditioned on the state of the reader and the reformulated query is used to re-rank the paragraphs by the retriever. We conduct analysis and show that iterative interaction helps in retrieving informative paragraphs from the corpus. Finally, we show that our multistep-reasoning framework brings consistent improvement when applied to two widely used reader architectures (DR.QA and BIDAF) on various large open-domain datasets \u2014 TRIVIAQA-unfiltered, QUASAR-T, SEARCHQA, and SQUAD-open1."

        "We propose the following two desiderata for a general purpose open-domain question answering system - (a) The retriever model should be fast, since it has to find the relevant context from a very large text corpora and give it to the more sophisticated and computationally expensive machine reading comprehension model (b) Secondly, the retriever and reader models should be interactive, i.e. if the reader model is unable to find the answer from the initial retrieved context, the retriever should be able to learn to provide more relevant context to the reader",
