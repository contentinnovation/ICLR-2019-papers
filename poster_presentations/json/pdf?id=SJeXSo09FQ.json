        "abstract": "Point clouds are an important type of geometric data and have widespread use in computer graphics and vision. However, learning representations for point clouds is particularly challenging due to their nature as being an unordered collection of points irregularly distributed in 3D space. Graph convolution, a generalization of the convolution operation for data defined over graphs, has been recently shown to be very successful at extracting localized features from point clouds in supervised or semi-supervised tasks such as classification or segmentation. This paper studies the unsupervised problem of a generative model exploiting graph convolution. We focus on the generator of a GAN and define methods for graph convolution when the graph is not known in advance as it is the very output of the generator. The proposed architecture learns to generate localized features that approximate graph embeddings of the output geometry. We also study the problem of defining an upsampling layer in the graph-convolutional generator, such that it learns to exploit a self-similarity prior on the data distribution to sample more effectively."

        "This paper studies a generative model for point clouds based on graph convolution",
        "This poses a unique challenge: how can one apply a localized operation without knowing the domain in advance because it is the very output of the generator?

        "In Sec. 2.3 we claimed that these features learned by the generator are graph embeddings. We tested this hypothesis by measuring how much the adjacency matrix of the final point cloud, constructed as a nearest-neighbor graph in 3D, is successfully predicted by the nearest-neighbor adjacency matrix computed from hidden features. This is shown in Fig.5 which reports the percentage of edges correctly predicted as function of the number of neighbors considered for the graph of the output point cloud and a fixed number of 20 neighbors in the feature space",

        "Notice that the graph convolution we use can be seen as a generalization of this model, aggregating the features of neighboring points instead of processing each point independently.",
        "This is shown in Fig.5 which reports the percentage of edges correctly predicted as function of the number of neighbors considered for the graph of the output point cloud and a fixed number of 20 neighbors in the feature space.",
        "The mechanism learned by the network to generate new points is essentially to apply some mild transformation to a neighborhood and copy it in a different area of the feature space.",

        "We showed how constructing nearest neighbor graphs from generator features to implement the graph convolution operation promotes the features to be localized and to approximate a graph embedding of the output geometry.",
