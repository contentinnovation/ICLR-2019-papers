        "abstract": "Real-life control tasks involve matters of various substances\u2014rigid or soft bodies, liquid, gas\u2014each with distinct physical behaviors. This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations."

        "DPI-Nets combine three key features for effective particle-based simulation and control: multi-step spatial propagation, hierarchical particle structure, and dynamic interaction graphs.",
        "The use of dynamic graphs allows neural models to focus on learning meaningful interactions among particles, and is crucial for obtaining good simulation accuracy and high success rates in manipulation.",
        "An inspiring concurrent work from <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMrowca_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMrowca_et+al_2018_a\">Mrowca et al (2018</a>) explored learning to approximate particle dynamics of deformable shapes with the Hierarchical Relation Network (HRN).",
        "We demonstrate how the learned dynamics model can be used for control in both simulation and real world.",
        "Our model builds on and extends these approaches by learning a general physics simulator that takes raw object observations of each particle as input.",
        "The learned model can be used to infer the system dynamics and predict the future from the current interaction graph as Gt+1 = \u03c6(Gt), where Gt denotes the scene state at time t.",
        "We can rollout using the learned dynamics and optimize the control inputs by minimizing a loss between the simulated results and a target configuration.",
        "Our dynamic particle interaction network does forward simulation by taking the dynamics graph at time t as input, and produces the graph at time step, Gt+1 = \u03a6(Gt), where \u03a6 is implemented as DPI-Nets as described in the previous section.",
        "Table 1 shows that for environments that involve fluids (BoxBath and FluidShake), DPI-Net performs better than those with a static interaction graph.",
        "It is hard to capture long-range dependence, leading to performance drop in environments that involve hierarchical object modeling (BoxBath and RiceGrip).",
        "As there are only a few states of interest, and their physical behaviors are drastically different, it is not surprising that DPI-Nets, with state-specific motion predictors, perform better, and are efficient as the unified model.",
        "We leverage dynamic particle interaction network for control tasks in both simulation and real world.",
        "Because trajectory optimization using shooting method can stuck to a local minimum, we first randomly sample Nsample control sequences, and select the best performing one according to the rollouts of our learned model.",
        "Figure 4c and Figure 5b shows that, using DPI-Nets, the robot successfully adapts to the real world environment of unknown physical parameters and manipulates a deformable foam into various target shapes.",
