        "abstract": "Neural message passing algorithms for semi-supervised classification on graphs have recently achieved great success. However, for classifying a node these methods only consider nodes that are a few propagation steps away and the size of this utilized neighborhood is hard to extend. In this paper, we use the relationship between graph convolutional networks (GCN) and PageRank to derive an improved propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank. We utilize this propagation procedure to construct a simple model, personalized propagation of neural predictions (PPNP), and its fast approximation, APPNP. Our model\u2019s training time is on par or faster and its number of parameters on par or lower than previous models. It leverages a large, adjustable neighborhood for classification and can be easily combined with any neural network. We show that this model outperforms several recently proposed methods for semi-supervised classification in the most thorough study done so far for GCN-like models. Our implementation is available online. 1"

    "summary": [
        "Graphs are ubiquitous in the real world and its description through scientific models.",
        "This allows us to achieve a much higher range without changing the neural network, whereas in the message passing scheme every additional propagation step would require an additional layer.",
        "It permits the independent development of the propagation algorithm and the neural network generating predictions from node features.",
        "We even found that adding our propagation scheme during inference significantly improves the accuracy of networks that were trained without using any graph information.",
        "To utilize the above influence scores for semi-supervised classification we generate predictions for each node based on its own features and propagate them via our fully personalized PageRank scheme to generate the final predictions.",
        "As we saw when connecting GCN to PageRank, personalized PageRank can effectively use even infinitely many neighborhood aggregation layers, which is clearly not possible in the classical message passing framework.",
        "Z(K) = softmax (1 \u2212 \u03b1)AZ(K\u22121) + \u03b1H , where the prediction matrix H acts as both the starting vector and the teleport set, K defines the number of power iteration steps and k \u2208 [0, K \u22122].",
        "Several works have tried to improve the training of message passing algorithms and increase the neighborhood available at each node by adding skip connections (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2016_a\">Li et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPham_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rPham_et+al_2017_a\">Pham et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHamilton_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHamilton_et+al_2017_a\">Hamilton et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYing_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rYing_et+al_2018_a\">Ying et al, 2018</a>).",
        "To ensure a fair model comparison we used a neural network for PPNP that is structurally very similar to GCN and has the same number of parameters.",
        "The combination of this shallow neural network with a comparatively high number of power iteration steps achieved the best results during hyperparameter optimization.",
        "PPNP and APPNP are trained end-to-end, with the propagation scheme affecting (i) the neural network f\u03b8 during training, and the classification decision during inference.",
        "\u201dTraining\u201d denotes the case where we use APPNP during training to learn f\u03b8; at inference time, only f\u03b8 is used to predict the class labels.",
        "This shows that our model can be combined with pretrained neural networks that do not incorporate any graph information and still significantly improve their accuracy.",
        "This simple model decouples prediction and propagation and solves the limited range problem inherent in many message passing models without introducing any additional parameters.",
