        "abstract": "End-to-end task-oriented dialogue is challenging since knowledge bases are usually large, dynamic and hard to incorporate into a learning framework. We propose the global-to-local memory pointer (GLMP) networks to address this issue. In our model, a global memory encoder and a local memory decoder are proposed to share external knowledge. The encoder encodes dialogue history, modifies global contextual representation, and generates a global memory pointer. The decoder first generates a sketch response with unfilled slots. Next, it passes the global memory pointer to filter the external knowledge for relevant information, then instantiates the slots via the local memory pointers. We empirically show that our model can improve copy accuracy and mitigate the common out-of-vocabulary problem. As a result, GLMP is able to improve over the previous state-of-theart models in both simulated bAbI Dialogue dataset and human-human Stanford Multi-domain Dialogue dataset on automatic and human evaluation."

        "Note that for utterance retrieval methods, such as QRN, MN, and GMN, cannot correctly recommend options (T3) and provide additional information (T4), and a poor generalization ability is observed in OOV setting, which has around 30% performance difference in Task 5.",

        "GLMP without G means that we do not use the global memory pointer to modify the external knowledge, and an 11.47% entity F1 drop can be observed in SMD dataset.",
        "Some works view the task as a utterance retrieval problem, for examples, recurrent entity networks share parameters between RNN (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2017_a\">Wu et al, 2017</a>), query reduction networks modify query between layers (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSeo_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSeo_et+al_2017_a\">Seo et al, 2017</a>), and memory networks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBordes_2017_a\" href=\"#rBordes_2017_a\">Bordes & Weston, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_2017_a\" href=\"#rLiu_2017_a\">Liu & Perez, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2018_a\">Wu et al, 2018</a>) perform multi-hop design to strengthen reasoning ability.",
