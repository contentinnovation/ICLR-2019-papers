        "abstract": "Despite the recent successes in robotic locomotion control, the design of robots, i.e., the design of their body structure, still heavily relies on human engineering. Automatic robot design has been a long studied subject, however, progress has been slow due to large combinatorial search space and the difficulty to efficiently evaluate the candidate structures. Note that one needs to both, search over many possible body structures, and choose among them based on how the robot with that structure performs in an environment. The latter means training an optimal controller given a candidate structure, which in itself is costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE), which performs evolutionary search in graph space, by iteratively evolving graph structures using simple mutation primitives. Key to our approach is to parameterize the control policies with graph neural networks, which allows us to transfer skills from previously evaluated designs during the graph search. This significantly reduces evaluation cost of new candidates and makes the search process orders of magnitude more efficient than that of past work. In addition, NGE applies Graph Mutation with Uncertainty (GM-UC) by incorporating model uncertainty, which reduces the search space by balancing exploration and exploitation. We show that NGE significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of convergence rate and final performance. As shown in experiments, NGE is the first algorithm that can automatically discover kinematically preferred robotic graph structures, such as a fish with two symmetric flat side-fins and a tail, or a cheetah with athletic front and back legs. NGE is extremely efficient, it finds plausible robotic structures within a day on a single 64 CPU-core Amazon EC2 machine."
