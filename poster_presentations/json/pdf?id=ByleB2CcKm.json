        "abstract": "Clustering methods and latent variable models are often used as tools for pattern mining and discovery of latent structure in time-series data. In this work, we consider the problem of learning procedural abstractions from possibly highdimensional observational sequences, such as video demonstrations. Given a dataset of time-series, the goal is to identify the latent sequence of steps common to them and label each time-series with the temporal extent of these procedural steps. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model called PRISM that models the realization of a common procedure across multiple time-series, and can recover procedural abstractions without supervision. We also bring to light two characteristics ignored by traditional evaluation criteria when evaluating latent temporal labelings (temporal clusterings) \u2013 segment structure, and repeated structure \u2013 and develop new metrics tailored to their evaluation. We demonstrate that our metrics improve interpretability and ease of analysis for evaluation on benchmark time-series datasets. Results on benchmark and video datasets indicate that PRISM outperforms standard sequence models as well as state-of-the-art techniques in identifying procedural abstractions."

        "There exists an enormous wealth of videos of procedures available and inferring the latent structure of such videos could be useful in a huge range of applications, from supporting search queries (\u201dfind all segments where someone jacks up the car\u201d) to adding to nascent work on learning from observation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBorsa_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBorsa_et+al_2017_a\">Borsa et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadie_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rStadie_et+al_2017_a\">Stadie et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTorabi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rTorabi_et+al_2018_a\">Torabi et al, 2018</a>) in which robots may be taught merely by observing a procedure performed in a video",
        "Procedural learning is related to activity recognition and the broader field of latent temporal dynamical learning, but focuses on the simpler but still ubiquitous setting where the latent activity sequence is a fixed procedure",
        "We identify at least two key aspects of temporal latent structure discovery that are not captured well with existing non-temporal metrics: segment structure, the temporal durations between transitions from one discrete latent state to another, and repeated structure, where a particular latent variable may appear in multiple segments",
        "Instead we introduce a new generative Bayesian model (PRISM) for identifying procedural abstractions without supervision",
        "The locations and sizes of the segments in ground-truth e.g. in Fig 3 we would like temporal clusterings that switch between primitives at exactly the time points t = 2, 4 with the same 3 segment structure",
        "We describe a new evaluation criteria, called the repeated structure score (RSS) below",
        "We have introduced several new metrics: (i) the repeated structure score systematically scores repeated structure; the label-agnostic segmentation score scores how well the transition structure is captured; the segment structure score provides a unified metric for assessing segment structure",
        "As we show later in experiments, this structure can help PRISM outperform these methods, especially when the observations are noisy",
        "In Fig 6a, Sparse SC is worst on label-agnostic segmentation score-O since it heavily over-segments the time-series by introducing many transitions, while Temporal SC introduces far fewer transitions",
        "We find that normalized mutual information is highly sensitive to the number of clusters \u2013 Sparse SC only uses 2 clusters, which means it is heavily penalized by normalized mutual information, in spite of capturing some repeated structure",
        "We evaluate the benefit of our approach on the JIGSAWS dataset (Gao et al, 2014), which consists of surgeons with varying skill demonstrating common procedures, such as suturing, needle-passing and knot-tying",
        "We find that PRISM\u2019s performance is quite stable with respect to both \u2013 this holds as long as s is larger than the number of segments in ground-truth, and K is close to the true number of ground-truth clusters",

        "Existing metrics cannot score repeated or segment structure because they convert temporal clusterings to standard clusterings \u2013 a contingency matrix (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRosenberg_2007_a\" href=\"#rRosenberg_2007_a\">Rosenberg & Hirschberg, 2007</a>) \u2013 before evaluation.",
        "We provide a single evaluation measure for temporal clusterings, the temporal structure score (TSS) that balances the RSS with the SSS.",
        "We have argued the importance of evaluating repeated and segment structure correctly in temporal data.",
        "The goal is to label the temporal structure present in each time-series while identi- \u03bb fying the common, latent procedure.",
        "These papers typically assume a general setting where activities or latent tokens may be reused within or across multiple time-series but there is no onus on methods to discover this structure.",
        "Procedure identification requires that methods return a common procedure in addition to the temporal clustering of each time-series.",
        "Finding a common procedure P corresponds to finding temporal clusterings Ci for each time-series, such that P = P(C1) = P(C2) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = P(Cn).",
        "In contrast to a Gaussian mixture model, PRISM shares statistical strength across time-series by using a structured prior over the local variables that generate each observation \u2013 amortizing the procedure across many timeseries.",
        "Fig 6e shows the result of evaluating with just the RSS \u2013 we can clearly see that SpatSC is able to capture far more repeated structure than SHDP-HMM, which is unable to label segments from the same ground-truth label consistently.",
        "We expect our method to perform worse on the Breakfast actions dataset, as it has no repeated structure, in which case our model has no advantages over this prior model, and uses a simpler observation model.",
