        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an expressive class of neural generative models with tremendous success in modeling high-dimensional continuous measures. In this paper, we present a scalable method for unbalanced optimal transport (OT) based on the generativeadversarial framework. We formulate unbalanced OT as a problem of simultaneously learning a transport map and a scaling factor that push a source measure to a target measure in a cost-optimal manner. We provide theoretical justification for this formulation, showing that it is closely related to an existing static formulation by Liero et al. (2018). We then propose an algorithm for solving this problem based on stochastic alternating gradient updates, similar in practice to GANs, and perform numerical experiments demonstrating how this methodology can be applied to population modeling."

        "This formulation is obtained by relaxing the marginal constraints of (2) using divergences as follows: given two positive measures \u03bc \u2208 M+(X ) and \u03bd \u2208 M+(Y) and a cost function c : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R+, optimal entropy-transport finds a measure \u03b3 \u2208 M+(X \u00d7 Y) that minimizes",
        "We propose the first algorithm for unbalanced OT that directly models mass variation and can be applied towards transport between high-dimensional continuous measures.",
        "The starting point of our development is the following Monge-like formulation of unbalanced OT, in which the goal is to learn a stochastic transport map and scaling factor to push a source to a target measure in a cost-optimal manner.",
        "Using the relaxation of unbalanced Monge OT in (6), we show that the transport map and scaling factor can be learned by stochastic gradient methods.",
        "The probabilistic Monge-like formulation (6) is similar to the Kantorovichlike entropy-transport problem (3) in theory, but they result in quite different numerical methods in practice.",
