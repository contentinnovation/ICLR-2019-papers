        "abstract": "Discretizing multi-dimensional data distributions is a fundamental step of modern indexing methods. State-of-the-art techniques learn parameters of quantizers on training data for optimal performance, thus adapting quantizers to the data. In this work, we propose to reverse this paradigm and adapt the data to the quantizer: we train a neural net which last layer forms a fixed parameter-free quantizer, such as pre-defined points of a hyper-sphere. As a proxy objective, we design and train a neural network that favors uniformity in the spherical latent space, while preserving the neighborhood structure after the mapping. We propose a new regularizer derived from the Kozachenko\u2013Leonenko differential entropy estimator to enforce uniformity and combine it with a locality-aware triplet loss. Experiments show that our end-to-end approach outperforms most learned quantization methods, and is competitive with the state of the art on widely adopted benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that training without the quantization step results in almost no difference in accuracy, but yields a generic catalyzer that can be applied with any subsequent quantizer. The code is available online1."

        "As illustrated by Figure 1, we aim at learning a function that maps real-valued vectors to a uniform distribution over a d-dimensional sphere, such that a fixed discretizing structure, for example a fixed binary encoding or a regular lattice quantizer, offers competitive coding performance.",
        "We learn a mapping such that the output follows the distribution under which the subsequent discretization method, either binary or a more general quantizer, performs better.",

        "The positive matches are obtained by computing the kpos nearest neighbors of each point x in the training set in the input space.",
        "While Figure 2 illustrates our method with the 2D disk as an output space, we are interested in mapping input samples to a higher dimensional hyper-sphere.",
        "We consider two parameter-free coding methods: binarization and defining a fixed set of points on the unit sphere provided by a lattice spherical quantizer.",
        "We are closer to uniformity in the output space, making lattices an attractive choice.",
        "We train our neural network on the training set, cross-validate dout and \u03bb on the validation set, and use a different set of vectors for evaluation.",

        "Our search time is a bit slower: computing 1M asymmetric distances takes 7.5 ms with the Catalyzer+Lattice instead of 4.9 ms with PQ.",
        "We show the interest of our method as a catalyzer for binary hashing, compared to two popular methods (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCharikar_2002_a\" href=\"#rCharikar_2002_a\">Charikar, 2002</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGong_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGong_et+al_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGong_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGong_et+al_2013_a\">Gong et al, 2013</a></a>): LSH maps Euclidean vectors to binary codes that are compared with Hamming distance.",
