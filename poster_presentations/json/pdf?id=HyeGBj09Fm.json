        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for deformation-aware neural networks that learn the weighting and synthesis of dense volumetric deformation fields. Our method specifically targets the space-time representation of physical surfaces from liquid simulations. Liquids exhibit highly complex, non-linear behavior under changing simulation conditions such as different initial conditions. Our algorithm captures these complex phenomena in two stages: a first neural network computes a weighting function for a set of pre-computed deformations, while a second network directly generates a deformation field for refining the surface. Key for successful training runs in this setting is a suitable loss function that encodes the effect of the deformations, and a robust calculation of the corresponding gradients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase our method with several complex examples of flowing liquids with topology changes. Our representation makes it possible to rapidly generate the desired implicit surfaces. We have implemented a mobile application to demonstrate that real-time interactions with complex liquid effects are possible with our approach."

        "We represent a single 3D input surface over time as a four-dimensional signed-distance function (SDF), which we deform in both space and time with learned deformations to recover the desired physical behavior.",
        "A novel deformation-aware neural network approach to very efficiently represent large collections of space-time surfaces with complex behavior.",
        "We generate an approximation of \u03c6\u03b1 by deforming a single initial surface in space and time.",
        "The main difficulty lies in the non-linearity of the deformations, which is why we propose a novel method to robustly approximate both functions with NNs: fp will be represented by the parameter network to compute \u03b2, and we make use of a deformation network that to generate w.",
        "Learning Deformation Weights For training the NNs we propose the following objective function, which measures the similarity of a known reference surface \u03c6\u03b1 and the corresponding, approximated result \u03c80(x, \u03b1) for a parameter value \u03b1.",

        "The inferred deformation of our deformation network further reduces the surface loss to 26.6% of its initial value, as shown in Fig. 4.",
        "Once we introduce a regular initial surface for \u03c80, in this case the zero parameter configuration with the drop in one corner of the domain with the largest size, our networks perform even better than for the 2D data discussed above.",
        "As with the two previously discussed data sets, our approach leads to very significant reductions of the surface loss across the full parameter space, with a final residual loss of 31.3% after applying the learned deformation.",
