        "abstract": "Classical models describe primary visual cortex (V1) as a filter bank of orientationselective linear-nonlinear (LN) or energy models, but these models fail to predict neural responses to natural stimuli accurately. Recent work shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to predict V1 activity more accurately, but it remains unclear which features are extracted by V1 neurons beyond orientation selectivity and phase invariance. Here we work towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework for identifying common features independent of individual neurons\u2019 orientation selectivity by using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this rotation-equivariant CNN to responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our rotation-equivariant network outperforms a regular CNN with the same number of feature maps and reveals a number of common features, which are shared by many V1 neurons and are pooled sparsely to predict neural activity. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to study the nonlinear functional organization of visual cortex."

        "These models are completely identical in terms of number of layers, filter sizes, readout layer and fitting procedure, except for the weight sharing constraint across orientation.",

        "To ensure that the sparsity of the feature weights is a property of the data and not a trivial result of our L1 penalty, we performed an ablation study, where we fit a model that applies sparsity only on the spatial masks, but uses L2 regularization for the feature weights.",
        "There is a second line of evidence that the features learned by our model are meaningful beyond just providing an arbitrary basis of a 16-dimensional feature space in which neurons are placed at random: the weights that different neurons assign to any given feature have remarkably consistent signs (Fig. 5).",
