        "abstract": "Human perception of 3D shapes goes beyond reconstructing them as a set of points or a composition of geometric primitives: we also effortlessly understand higherlevel shape structure such as the repetition and reflective symmetry of object parts. In contrast, recent advances in 3D shape sensing focus more on low-level geometry but less on these higher-level relationships. In this paper, we propose 3D shape programs, integrating bottom-up recognition systems with top-down, symbolic program structure to capture both low-level geometry and high-level structural priors for 3D shapes. Because there are no annotations of shape programs for real shapes, we develop neural modules that not only learn to infer 3D shape programs from raw, unannotated shapes, but also to execute these programs for shape reconstruction. After initial bootstrapping, our end-to-end differentiable model learns 3D shape programs by reconstructing shapes in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that our model accurately infers and executes 3D shape programs for highly complex shapes from various categories. It can also be integrated with an image-to-shape module to infer 3D shape programs directly from an RGB image, leading to 3D shape reconstructions that are both more accurate and more physically plausible."

        "Given the table in Figure 1, humans are able to instantly recognize its parts and regularities: there exist sharp edges, smooth surfaces, a table top that is a perfect circle, and two lower, square layers.",
        "With the learned neural program executor, our model learns to explain input shapes without ground truth program annotations.",
        "We demonstrate that the inference model, the executor, and the programs they recover all achieve good performance on ShapeNet, learning to explain and reconstruct complex shapes.",
        "The neural program executor takes these programs as input and generates the corresponding 3D shapes.",
        "We propose to learn a neural program executor, an approximate but differentiable graphics engine, which generates a shape from a program.",
        "Our use of a neural, differentiable executor enables gradient-based fine-tuning of the program synthesizer on unannotated shapes, which allows the model to generalize effectively to novel shapes outside training categories.",
        "We decompose the problem by learning an executor that executes programs at the block level, e.g., either a single drawing statement or a compound statements.",
        "With the learned differentiable neural program executor, we can adapt our model to other datasets such as ShapeNet, where program-level supervision is not available.",
        "We execute the predicted program by the learned neural program executor and compute the reconstruction loss between the generated shape and the input.",
        "We present program generation and shape reconstruction results on three datasets: our synthetic dataset, ShapeNet (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChang_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rChang_et+al_2015_a\">Chang et al, 2015</a>), and Pix3D (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2018_b\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2018_b\">Sun et al, 2018b</a>).",
        "After our model generates programs from input shapes, we execute these programs with a graphics engine and measure the reconstruction quality.",
        "The initial programs for pre-training can be very simple: e.g., 10 simple table templates (Fig. A1) are sufficient to initialize the model, which later achieves good performance under execution-guided adaptation.",
        "Figure 5 shows some program generation and shape reconstruction results for tables and chairs, respectively.",
        "Our model is able to extract more meaningful programs and reconstruct the input shape reasonably well.",
        "While our program generator is pre-trained only on synthetic chairs and tables, generalization on other shape categories is desirable.",
        "Table 4 suggests the pre-trained model performs poorly for these unseen shapes but its performance improves with this unsupervised guided adaptation.",
        "We separately train a MarrNet (Wu et al, 2017) model for chairs and tables on ShapeNet, and reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D images on the Pix3D dataset.",
        "Experiments on ShapeNet show that our model successfully explains shapes as programs and generalizes to shapes outside training categories."
