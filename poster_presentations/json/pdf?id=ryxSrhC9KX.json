        "abstract": "To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories. These representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments. Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership, functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings, suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of objects beyond the specific task."

        "A central goal in understanding the human mind is to determine how object concepts are represented and how they relate to human behavior.",
        "Semantic representation of concepts Our method, Sparse Positive Similarity Embedding (SPoSE) is based on three assumptions.",
        "Each feature/dimension xif in the vector xi is real and non-negative, so as to make it interpretable as the degree to which the aspect of meaning it represents is present and influences subject behavior (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMurphy_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rMurphy_et+al_2012_a\">Murphy et al, 2012</a>).",
        "Probabilistic model Our second assumption is that the decision in a given trial is explained as a function of the similarity between the embedding vectors of the three concepts presented.",
        "The model in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTamuz_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rTamuz_et+al_2011_a\">Tamuz et al (2011</a>) could be extended to the three-choice triplet task with sparsity and positivity constraints, but it would require an extra tuning parameter \u03bc, in addition to the L1 sparsity penalty \u03bb which is needed to obtain sparse embeddings.",
        "A different way of examining prediction quality is to pool data across many triplets, by considering similarities between pairs of objects.",
        "These results demonstrate that SPoSE dimensions contain the information present in the main CSLB features for the 413 objects considered.",
        "We fit a L1-regularized non-negative regression model (NNLS) to predict each of the 49 SPoSE features from the 5,929 CSLB features, for all 496 concepts present in both datasets.",
        "We fit a model to the entire dataset, in order to use the NNLS regression weights to determine which CSLB features most influenced the prediction of each SPoSE dimension.",
        "This representation, which embeds each object in a 49-dimensional vector, allows prediction of subject behavior in face of new combinations of concepts not encountered before, as well as prediction of other behavioral or human-annotated data, such as typicality ratings or similarity judgments.",
        "As the representations were estimated solely from behavioral data, this suggests a simple model of decision making in the triplet task.",
        "The use of sparsity and positivity in the SPoSE representation, and the vector dot product for computing concept similarity, blends the featural and dimensional approaches when making decisions about a triplet of concepts.",
        "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 is to consider different types of similarity judgments (Veit et al, 2017), e.g. resulting from asking subjects to group objects based on a specific attribute.",
        "One avenue for trying to identify this type of information is to predict synset vectors from SPoSE vectors and/or semantic features elicited from subjects, and represent the residuals in terms of a dictionary of new sparse, positive concept features."
