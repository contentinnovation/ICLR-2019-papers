        "abstract": "Representation Learning over graph structured data has received significant attention recently due to its ubiquitous applicability. However, most advancements have been made in static graph settings while efforts for jointly learning dynamic of the graph and dynamic on the graph are still in an infant stage. Two fundamental questions arise in learning over dynamic graphs: (i) How to elegantly model dynamical processes over graphs? (ii) How to leverage such a model to effectively encode evolving graph information into low-dimensional representations? We present DyRep - a novel modeling framework for dynamic graphs that posits representation learning as a latent mediation process bridging two observed processes namely \u2013 dynamics of the network (realized as topological evolution) and dynamics on the network (realized as activities between nodes). Concretely, we propose a two-time scale deep temporal point process model that captures the interleaved dynamics of the observed processes. This model is further parameterized by a temporal-attentive representation network that encodes temporally evolving structural information into node representations which in turn drives the nonlinear evolution of the observed graph dynamics. Our unified framework is trained using an efficient unsupervised procedure and has capability to generalize over unseen nodes. We demonstrate that DyRep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for dynamic link prediction and time prediction tasks and present extensive qualitative insights into our framework."

        "Event Observation \u2013 Both communication and association processes are realized in the form of dyadic events observed between nodes on graph G over a temporal window [t0, T ] and ordered by time.",
        "The goal is to learn node representations that encode information evolving due to such local and global effects and further drive the dynamics of the observed events.",
        "The observations over dynamic graph contain temporal point patterns of two interleaved complex processes in the form of communication and association events respectively.",
        "End, we propose a novel Temporal Point Process based Attention Mechanism that uses temporal information to compute the attention coefficient for a structural edge between nodes.",
        "The key innovation in our model is the parameterization of attention mechanism by a point process based temporal quantity S that is evolving and drives the impact that each neighbor has on the given node.",
        "We compare with Know-Evolve (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTrivedi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rTrivedi_et+al_2017_a\">Trivedi et al, 2017</a>)\u2014 a state-of-the-art model for multi-relational dynamic graphs where each edge has time-stamp and type, DynGem (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGoyal_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rGoyal_et+al_2017_a\">Goyal et al, 2017</a>)\u2014divides timeline into discrete time points and learns embedding for the graph snapshots at these time points.",

        "For dynamic baselines that do not explicitly model time (DynGem, DynTrd, GraphSage) and static baselines (Node2Vec), we adopt a sliding window training approach with warm-start method where we learn on initial train set and test for the first slot.",
        "Know-Evolve can capture event dynamics well and shows consistently better rank than others but its performance deteriorates significantly in HITS@10 metric over time.",
        "The inability of DynGem, DynTrd and GraphSage to significantly outperform Node2vec demonstrate that discrete time snapshot based models fail to capture fine-grained dynamics of communication events.",
