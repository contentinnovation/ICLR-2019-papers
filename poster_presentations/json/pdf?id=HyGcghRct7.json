        "abstract": "We propose a new learning-based approach to solve ill-posed inverse problems in imaging. We address the case where ground truth training samples are rare and the problem is severely ill-posed\u2014both because of the underlying physics and because we can only get few measurements. This setting is common in geophysical imaging and remote sensing. We show that in this case the common approach to directly learn the mapping from the measured data to the reconstruction becomes unstable. Instead, we propose to first learn an ensemble of simpler mappings from the data to projections of the unknown image into random piecewise-constant subspaces. We then combine the projections to form a final reconstruction by solving a deconvolution-like problem. We show experimentally that the proposed method is more robust to measurement noise and corruptions not seen during training than a directly learned inverse."

        "The two stages of our method are (i) decomposing a \u201chard\u201d learning task of directly learning an unstable operator into an ensemble of \u201ceasy\u201d tasks of estimating projections of the unknown model into low-dimensional subspaces; and combining these projection estimates to solve a reformulated inverse problem for x.",
        "Similar to Jin et al (2016), we do not use the measured data y \u2208 RM directly as this would require the network to first learn to map y back to the image domain; we rather warm-start the reconstruction by a non-negative least squares reconstruction, y \u2208 RN , computed from y.",
        "We observe empirically that \u03c3min(B)\u22121 grows large as the number of subspaces increases which reflects the fact that individual projections are easier to learn, the full-resolution reconstruction remains ill-posed.",
