        "abstract": "Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the stateof-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality."

        "More and more large datasets are becoming available in a wide variety of communities.",
        "Using two Kaggle datasets, two different real-world medical datasets and two UCI datasets, we evaluate the utility of the samples generated by PATE-GAN in various settings with various levels of differential privacy.",
        "The first method, first proposed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], compares the predictive performance of models trained on the synthetic datasets and tested on the real dataset.",
        "The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we modify the PATE framework and apply it to GANs to generate synthetic data, (2) we demonstrate in the experiments section that using PATE to enforce differential privacy results in higher quality synthetic data than DPGAN using various real-world datasets, (3) we propose a novel new metric for evaluating the generated synthetic data.",
        "The key to the GAN framework is that the discriminator is a differentiable module trained to classify samples as either real or generated.",
        "The PATE framework provides a differentially private mechanism for classification by training multiple teacher models on disjoint partitions of the data.",
        "The PATE mechanism provides a differentially private method for classification, a core component of the GAN framework; the discriminator is a classifier trained to identify whether samples are real/fake.",
        "The student, S, is a classifier that is trained by taking some public, unlabelled data, P = {xi}Ki=1, passing each sample, xi, through the PATE mechanism, to receive a differentially private label, yi, and forming a newteacher-labelled dataset P = {}Ki=1 on which the student is trained.",
        "We replace the GAN discriminator with a PATE mechanism so that our discriminator is differentially private, but require the student version to allow back-propagation to the generator.",
        "That the student training paradigm described in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] would involve training the student using data similar to that used to train the generator - i.e. by taking an equal number of samples from each and labelling those using the standard PATE\u03bb mechanism.",
        "We use d real and d generated samples to train each teacher where d is the dimension of the input space.",
        "We see that PATE-GAN is capable of generating synthetic samples that better preserve the feature-label relationship than DPGAN.",
        "We believe this is because the PATE mechanism allows us to more tightly bound the influence of a single sample on the discriminator, and we can provide tighter differential privacy guarantees - when the differential privacy guarantee is fixed, this results in higher quality synthetic data."
