        "abstract": "The ground-breaking performance obtained by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks is inspiring research efforts attempting to extend it for 3D geometric tasks. One of the main challenge in applying CNNs to 3D shape analysis is how to define a natural convolution operator on noneuclidean surfaces. In this paper, we present a method for applying deep learning to 3D surfaces using their spherical descriptors and alt-az anisotropic convolution on 2-sphere. A cascade set of geodesic disk filters rotate on the 2-sphere and collect spherical patterns and so to extract geometric features for various 3D shape analysis tasks. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that our proposed method has the possibility to bridge the gap between 2D images and 3D shapes with the desired rotation equivariance/invariance, and its effectiveness is evaluated in applications of non-rigid/ rigid shape classification and shape retrieval."

        "A recent research effort in computer vision and geometric processing communities is towards replicating the incredible success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from the image analysis to 3D shape analysis.",
        "Following are the main contributions of our paper: (1) theoretical analysis of the relationship between various definition of convolutions for functions defined on the 2-sphere and a novel convolutional neural network using alt-az anisotropic spherical convolutions that emulates most aspects of standard convolutional networks in R2; (2) an efficient geodesic grid data structure to support fast computation of the spherical convolution with locally-supported geodesic disc filters; (3) an empirical demonstration of the utility of a3SCNN with 3D shape learning problems.",
        "Data augmentation After going through a set of a3SConv layers, the global azimuth rotation of an input spherical image f will be transformed into the same rotation of the extracted spherical descriptors).",
        "Considering the structure of the icosahedron-sphere grid, in order to obtain a multi-level spherical feature map, the stride of a convolution or pooling layer has to be a multiple of 2n.",
        "This construction has two main advances: (1) within each patch, shifting filters on the 2-sphere is approximately equivariant to translation in u and v and (2) features on the geodesic grid can naturally be expressed using tensors, which means that the spherical convolution can be efficiently implemented on a GPU.",
        "In spite the small training data, our network achieves good classification accuracy for Intrinsic-8 even without data augmentation.We attribute the capability to generalize to random perturbed data to the use of LMP layers, which allows a certain amount SO(3) rotation invariance.",
        "Two channels of spherical functions: SEF and NDF are used as the input and we use the same network structure as we use in SHREC\u201911, except that in the five cascaded a3Sconv layers, 32,64,128,256,512 filters are used, and in the first fully connected layer, 1024 features are generated for classification.",
        "Given the rather task agnostic architecture of our model and the lossy but compact input representation we use, we interpret our models performance as strong empirical support of the effectiveness of learning alt-az rotation invariant shape descriptors using alt-az spherical convolution operators.",
        "Our trained model obtains a 83% classification accuracy after about 24 hours of training and we use the 1024 features extracted from the first fully connected layer as the invariant shape descriptors to perform the shape similarity calculation using cosine distance.",
        "We implemented an efficient algorithm for computing spherical convolution with locally-supported geodesic filters using icosahedron-sphere grid.",
