        "abstract": "Routing models, a form of conditional computation where examples are routed through a subset of components in a larger network, have shown promising results in recent works. Surprisingly, routing models to date have lacked important properties, such as architectural diversity and large numbers of routing decisions. Both architectural diversity and routing depth can increase the representational power of a routing network. In this work, we address both of these deficiencies. We discuss the significance of architectural diversity in routing models, and explain the tradeoffs between capacity and optimization when increasing routing depth. In our experiments, we find that adding architectural diversity to routing models significantly improves performance, cutting the error rates of a strong baseline by 35% on an Omniglot setup. However, when scaling up routing depth, we find that modern routing techniques struggle with optimization. We conclude by discussing both the positive and negative results, and suggest directions for future research.",

        "Effective routing can be achieved by training another small neural network that learns to route examples through the supernetwork.",

        "We attempt to remedy this problem by introducing architectural diversity in routing models, with different experts having different architectures and parameters.",

        "Diverse routing networks generalize many neural architecture search methods.",

        "Since it is challenging to know apriori which set of operations work well for which dataset, this result suggests that adding diversity of operations to models in addition to adding multiple copies of a single important operation type is a straightforward way of creating routing models that work well for different datasets without requiring much tuning.",
