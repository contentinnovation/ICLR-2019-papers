        "abstract": "The impressive lifelong learning in animal brains is primarily enabled by plastic changes in synaptic connectivity. Importantly, these changes are not passive, but are actively controlled by neuromodulation, which is itself under the control of the brain. The resulting self-modifying abilities of the brain play an important role in learning and adaptation, and are a major basis for biological reinforcement learning. Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such neuromodulated plasticity can be trained with gradient descent. Extending previous work on differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a differentiable formulation for the neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that neuromodulated plasticity improves the performance of neural networks on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. In one task, neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters). We conclude that differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks."

        "We extend this framework to implement differentiable neuromodulated plasticity, in which the plasticity of connections can be modulated moment-to-moment through a signal computed by the network.",
        "None so far have taken the simple approach of directly optimizing the neuromodulation of plasticity itself within a single network, through gradient descent instead of evolution, as investigated here.",
        "The present work builds upon the existing differentiable plasticity framework (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\">Miconi, 2016</a></a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\">Miconi et al, 2018</a></a></a>), which allows gradient descent to optimize not just the weights, but the plasticity of each connection.",
        "Building upon the differentiable plasticity framework, which already improved performance over non-plastic architectures on various supervised and RL tasks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_2016_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_2016_a\">Miconi, 2016</a></a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiconi_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rMiconi_et+al_2018_a\">Miconi et al, 2018</a></a></a>), here we introduce neuromodulated plasticity to let the network control its own weight changes.",

        "As a complement to the benefits in the simple RL domains investigated, our finding that plastic and neuromodulated LSTMs outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task is potentially of great importance.",
        "Because our framework allows the network to update its own connectivity, we might potentially extend the L2RL model one level higher: rather than using A2C as a hand-designed reward-based weight-modification scheme, the system could determine its own arbitrary weight-modification scheme, which might make use of any signal it can compute This emergent weight-modifying algorithm might in turn sculpt network connectivity to implement the meta-learning process described by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2018_a\">Wang et al (2018</a>).",
