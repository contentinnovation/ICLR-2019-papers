        "abstract": "Analogical reasoning has been a principal focus of various waves of AI research. Analogy is particularly challenging for machines because it requires relational structures to be represented such that they can be flexibly applied across diverse domains of experience. Here, we study how analogical reasoning can be induced in neural networks that learn to perceive and reason about raw visual data. We find that the critical factor for inducing such a capacity is not an elaborate architecture, but rather, careful attention to the choice of data and the manner in which it is presented to the model. The most robust capacity for analogical reasoning is induced when networks learn analogies by contrasting abstract relational structures in their input domains, a training method that uses only the input data to force models to learn about important abstract features. Using this technique we demonstrate capacities for complex, visual and symbolic analogy making and generalisation in even the simplest neural network architectures."

This effect is observed for the prototypical analogical processes involving novel domain mappings and unfamiliar target domains (Experiments 1 & 2)",

This more controlled domain allows to show that the construction of appropriate incorrect answer candidates can be learned in a proposal model that is trained jointly with a model that learns to contrast the candidates, widening the potential applications of Learning Analogies By Contrasting to task settings where we lack a clear understanding of the underlying abstract relational structure (Sec 5.3)",

This method does not require any analogical reasoning, since the model can outright ignore the relation instantiated in the source set, which is precisely a type of back-door solution characteristic of neural network approaches",
