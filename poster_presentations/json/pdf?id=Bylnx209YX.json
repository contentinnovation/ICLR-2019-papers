        "abstract": "Deep learning models for graphs have advanced the state of the art on many tasks. Despite their recent success, little is known about their robustness. We investigate training time attacks on graph neural networks for node classification that perturb the discrete graph structure. Our core principle is to use meta-gradients to solve the bilevel problem underlying training-time attacks, essentially treating the graph as a hyperparameter to optimize. Our experiments show that small graph perturbations consistently lead to a strong decrease in performance for graph convolutional networks, and even transfer to unsupervised embeddings. Remarkably, the perturbations created by our algorithm can misguide the graph neural networks such that they perform worse than a simple baseline that ignores all relational information. Our attacks do not assume any knowledge about or access to the target classifiers."

        "We propose the first algorithm for poisoning attacks that is able to compromise the global node classification performance of a model.",
        "<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZugner_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rZugner_et+al_2018_a\">Zugner et al (2018</a>) consider both test-time and training-time attacks on node classification models.",
        "For the first time, we propose an algorithm for global attacks on node classification models at training time.",
        "The attacker\u2019s goal is to increase the misclassification rate of a node classification algorithm achieved after training on the data modified by our algorithm.",
        "The attacker can perform selflearning, i.e. use these predicted labels and compute the loss of a model on the unlabeled nodes, yielding our second option Latk = \u2212Lself where Lself = L(VU , CU ).",
        "Notice the bilevel nature of the problem formulation in Eq (2): the attacker aims to maximize the classification loss achieved after optimizing the model parameters on the modified graph G.",
        "The core idea behind our adversarial attack algorithm is to treat the graph structure matrix as a hyperparameter and compute the gradient of the attacker\u2019s loss after training with respect to it:",
        "Afterwards the poisoned data is used to train deep learning models for node classification to evaluate the performance degradation due to the attack.",
        "This corresponds to taking the gradient of the attack loss Latk w.r.t. the data, after training the model for T steps.",
        "We evaluate the transferability of adversarial attacks by training deep node classification models on the modified data.",
        "Deep models achieve higher accuracy than the baseline when trained on the clean CITESEER graph \u2013 exploiting the network information improves classification.",
        "Note that the classification accuracy barely changes when modifying the underlying network for a given set of trained weights; even when applying the clean weights W on the highly corrupted A, the performance drops only marginally.",
        "This result emphasizes the importance of the training procedure for the performance of graph models and shows that our poisoning attack works by derailing the training procedure from the start, i.e. leading to \u2018bad\u2019 weights.",
        "We propose an algorithm for training-time adversarial attacks on graphs, focusing on the task of node classification.",

        "Our experiments show that attacks created using our meta-gradient approach consistently lead to a strong decrease in classification performance of graph convolutional models and even transfer to unsupervised models.",
        "While we are able to show small statistical differences of adversarial and \u2018normal\u2019 edges, it is still an open question what makes the edges inserted/removed by our algorithm so destructive, which could be used to detect or defend against attacks"
