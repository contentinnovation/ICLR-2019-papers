        "abstract": "Feature selection is a pervasive problem. The discovery of relevant features can be as important for performing a particular task (such as to avoid overfitting in prediction) as it can be for understanding the underlying processes governing the true label (such as discovering relevant genetic factors for a disease). Machine learning driven feature selection can enable discovery from large, high-dimensional, nonlinear observational datasets by creating a subset of features for experts to focus on. In order to use expert time most efficiently, we need a principled methodology capable of controlling the False Discovery Rate. In this work, we build on the promising Knockoff framework by developing a flexible knockoff generation model. We adapt the Generative Adversarial Networks framework to allow us to generate knockoffs with no assumptions on the feature distribution. Our model consists of 4 networks, a generator, a discriminator, a stability network and a power network. We demonstrate the capability of our model to perform feature selection, showing that it performs as well as the originally proposed knockoff generation model in the Gaussian setting and that it outperforms the original model in non-Gaussian settings, including on a real-world dataset."

        "As noted in the introduction, the theory in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] holds independent of the distribution of the features - relying only on being able to generate valid knockoffs.",
        "They only propose a method for generating knockoffs when the distribution of features is jointly Gaussian.",
        "While they do propose a method for generating approximate knockoffs in the non-Gaussian setting, the guarantees on FDR control do not hold for their approximate knockoffs.",
        "In this paper we use a framework motivated by GANs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] to learn to generate knockoffs without any assumptions on the distribution of the features.",
        "In order to satisfy equation (1) we use a modified GAN framework, which gives us the flexibility to learn to generate knockoffs without any assumptions on the distribution of the original features.",
        "The relevant variables are sampled uniformly at random from among the 1000 features; in the non-auto-regressive settings this is not necessary.",
        "We found in this case that KnockoffGAN was able to control the FDR and achieve a similar TPR to the original knockoff framework.",
        "We expect to outperform the original Knockoff framework due to the fact that they approximate the distribution as Gaussian.",
        "KnockoffGAN does not place any requirements on the distribution of the features and as such is able to generate valid knockoffs.",
        "We performed experiments for several different underlying feature distributions, and found that KnockoffGAN achieved a higher TPR than the original knockoff framework in all cases, while controlling the FDR at the specified level.",
        "We see in Fig. 3 that KnockoffGAN consistently outperforms the original knockoff framework, achieving a higher TPR across the entire range of \u03b1 while consistently controlling the FDR at 10%.",
        "As noted in Section 4.3, there is no trade-off introduced by the inclusion of this regularizer; the optimal solution to the loss is unchanged and this regularization is \u201dfree\u201d in terms of FDR control, but as demonstrated improves TPR performance.",
        "The remaining features are all supported by the literature in PubMed. While this is a qualitative result, we do believe this demonstrates that KnockoffGAN is a significant improvement over the original knockoff generation procedure.",
        "We demonstrated through a series of experiments on a range of synthetic datasets and on a real world dataset that our method improves on the performance of the original knockoff framework.",
        "Generalizing this method to time-series data would be non-trivial, and would be an interesting avenue for further investigation"
